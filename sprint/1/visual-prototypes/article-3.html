          <p>Since 1980, the UK population has grown by 7.8 million people (13.8%). Around half of this growth has occurred since 2005, due to an increase in the number of births and an increase in net inward migration following the EU expansion in 2004.</p>

          <p>Between 1999 and 2011 net migration was the main component of population change in the UK. However, births have exceeded deaths throughout the last two decades and since 2002 there has been a marked increase in the number of births, with 2012 having the highest number since 1972. The increase in the number of births has been driven both by the immigration of women who are currently of childbearing age and by rising fertility among UK-born women.</p>
          <p>In the year to mid-2013, the population increased by 400,600. 212,100 or 53% of this increase was due to natural change or the difference between births and deaths. 183,400 or 46% of the increase was due to net international migration which is the difference between international immigration and international emigration during the year.</p>
          <p>Current and past international migration also has indirect effects on the size of the population as it changes the numbers of births and deaths in the UK. For example, statistics on the number of births by the country of birth of the mother show that 196,777 live births (25% of total live births) in the UK in 2013 were to mothers born outside the UK.</p>
          <p>For more analysis of these changes, please see this article on <a href="#">Migration to the UK</a>.</p>

          <p>A boy born in the UK in 1980 could expect to live 84.7 years on average. For a boy born today (2015) the figure is 91.0 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2037 it is projected to be 94.3 years.</p>
          <p>Similarly, a girl born in 1980 could expect to live 88.8 years on average. For a girl born today (2015) the figure is 94.3 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2037 it is projected to be 97.3 years.</p>
          <p>With life expectancy increasing, the UK’s population will age. This will affect a number of policy areas, including pensions and the health service – particularly because healthy life expectancy is not increasing as quickly.</p>

          <p>Although the 90 and over group account for only a very small proportion of the UK population (0.8% in 2013), the size of this age group relative to the rest has increased over time. This illustrates the UK’s ageing population.</p>
          <h2 class="font-weight--bold">Conclusion: An increasing and ageing population</h2>
          <p>The UK population is both increasing and ageing. Current projections show this pattern is set to continue.</p>

            <span class="font-size--xlarge font-weight--bold">73.3</span><br />
            <span class="font-size--h2">Million, projected UK population</span><br />
            2037
          </p>
          <p>That’s an increase of 9.2 million (13%) compared with 2013 as a result of births minus deaths, plus net migration.</p>
          <p>While a larger population increases the size and productive capacity of the workforce, it also increases demand for education, healthcare and housing.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, longer life expectancy is resulting in a growing older population. People working longer will increase the size of the labour force, but there will also be further pressure on services.  The old age dependency ratio is expected to increase in future years, although planned changes to the State Pension Age will slow this increase.</p>
