          <p>In 2012, it was decided that computing should be introduced as a GCSE, in an attempt to revive the legacy of mathematician and wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. Computing would focus more on building programs and learning to code, rather than learning the basics of using computers, which is what the already-existing ICT GCSE was focused on.</p>
          <p>While the old ICT GCSE is now being phased out, with the last batch of pupils taking their exams next year, there are concerns that the new Computing GCSE is not popular enough.</p>
          <p>The British Computing Society has <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40322796">voiced its worry</a> that a lack of interest in the topic at this level will lead to a shortage of skilled workers in this growing industry in future. The latest figures show that while the number of pupils taking Computing at GCSE is growing, insufficient numbers are signing up to meet future demand in the workforce.</p>
