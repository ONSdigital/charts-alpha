            <p>UK Business: Activity, Size and Location, 2016 is produced from an extract taken from the IDBR recording the position of units as at 11 March 2016.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of this release the term “business” is used to represent an enterprise. An enterprise can be defined as the smallest combination of legal units (generally based on VAT and/or PAYE records) that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its current resources. An enterprise carries out one or more activities at one or more locations. An enterprise may be a sole legal unit.</p>
            <p id="back"><a href="#info">Information about the IDBR</a></p>
            <p>This publication represents the businesses registered with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for VAT and/or Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) produces Business Population Estimates which seek to provide full coverage of all types of businesses in the UK including an estimate of the unregistered business population. </p>
            <p>During the period from March 2011 to March 2016, the Bank of England base rate was 0.5%. This historically low rate may have encouraged more businesses to set up over the period. The base rate may be linked to commercial loan rates to businesses which are often required to start up and invest in fixed capital.</p>
            <p>The employment rate rose from 70.5% in the 3 months to March 2011 to 74.2% in the 3 months to March 2016. The amount of people employed in the public sector from March 2011 to March 2016 fell when excluding reclassifications. The data suggest that the new employment growth from the 2011 to 2016 period was in the private sector. This is consistent with the continuing increase in the number of businesses which were set up between 2011 and 2016.</p>
