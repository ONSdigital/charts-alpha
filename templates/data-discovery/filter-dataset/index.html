        <h2>Iterations</h2>
        <h3>Heading</h3>
        <p>Usability testing has helped to improve the heading 1 on this page. Originally it was "Topics in this dataset" but this didn't test well. "Customise this dataset" was better un derstood, but sounded like "hard work" to users. "Filter this dataset" is better and seems to fit the user's mential model.</p>
        <h3>Filter links</h3>
        <p>Similarly, the links on the page were changed from "Change" to "Customise". Finally they were changed to "Filter" to match the user's mental model of the process.</p>
        <h3>Primary button</h3>
        <p>Changed from "Continue to download" to "Choose a download format" to better describe the process.</p>
        <h2>Things to explore</h2>
        <h3>Meta data</h3>
        <p>Could we add more metadata to help users understand each dimension?</p>
        <h3>Accessible links</h3>
        <p>The "Filter" links need some extra visually hidden text to give screen reader users more context.</p>
