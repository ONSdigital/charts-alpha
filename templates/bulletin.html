                <p>During the period from March 2011 to March 2016, the Bank of England base rate was 0.5%. This historically low rate may have encouraged more businesses to set up over the period. The base rate may be linked to commercial loan rates to businesses which are often required to start up and invest in fixed capital.</p>
                <p>The employment rate rose from 70.5% in the 3 months to March 2011 to 74.2% in the 3 months to March 2016. The amount of people employed in the public sector from March 2011 to March 2016 fell when excluding reclassifications. The data suggest that the new employment growth from the 2011 to 2016 period was in the private sector. This is consistent with the continuing increase in the number of businesses which were set up between 2011 and 2016.</p>
